In the early morning, when the sun is still rising, it’s essentially at its lowest point in the sky. In order for the sunlight to reach your panels at this time of the day, it has to cut through the most amount of atmosphere. This is important to note, because energy from the sun is absorbed when it travels through the atmosphere. So, this means that the more atmosphere it travels through, the more energy is absorbed and the less that is available for your panels to convert into electricity. At midday, when the sun is directly overhead, sunlight doesn’t need to travel through as much atmosphere. Therefore, your panels will absorb more sunlight during this time.\n","\n","- In winter, the same concept applies.
